    <p>
        The term èbà originates from Yoruba. It is a cooked starchy vegetable food made from dried grated cassava (manioc) flour
        commonly known as garri all across West Africa. It is often eaten with rich soups and stews, with beef, stockfish or
        mutton. The dish is often described as having a slightly sour, sharp taste.
